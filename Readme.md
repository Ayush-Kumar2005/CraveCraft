## 📖 About CraveCraft
CraveCraft is a modern **food ordering website** designed to deliver a smooth and delightful user experience.  
It allows users to browse a variety of restaurants, explore detailed menus, and seamlessly add food items to their cart.  

The project focuses on:
- **Performance** → fast loading with shimmer UI while fetching data.  
- **Reusability** → components like `RestaurantCard`, `FoodCard`, and `Shimmer` are designed for modular use.  
- **Scalability** → structured in a way that makes it easy to add new features like payment integration or order tracking.  
- **User Engagement** → a clean design with simple navigation ensures users can quickly find what they need.  

CraveCraft aims to simulate a real-world food delivery app like Swiggy/Zomato but in a lightweight and developer-friendly form.
